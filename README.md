# 🐾 Animal Detection System

A deep learning-based image classification system that detects and classifies animals into **cats**, **dogs**, or **squirrels**. The system uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for training on image datasets and is deployed using a Flask web interface.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project was developed as part of the **Artificial Intelligence** coursework at **National Textile University, Faisalabad**.

The model is trained on over 6000+ images and tested on 1200+ images using the following datasets:

- Animals-10 Dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alessiocorrado99/animals10

## 🖼️ Predicting New Images

```python
from keras.preprocessing import image
test_image = image.load_img('Prediction/ccc.jpeg', target_size=(64, 64))
test_image = image.img_to_array(test_image)
test_image = np.expand_dims(test_image, axis=0)
result = cnn.predict(test_image)

# Prediction logic
if result[0][0] == 1:
    print('cat')
elif result[0][1] == 1:
    print('dog')
elif result[0][2] == 1:
    print('squirrel')
```

---

## 🌐 Web Interface

The system is integrated with a user-friendly web interface using Flask. It allows users to upload images and receive predictions directly in the browser.

To run:

```bash
python app.py
```
